# macos dotfiles

I used to use macos back in 2011 but completely moved to linux

## Sierra

I'm in the process of updating this repo for sierra configs from a macbook.
Still not sure if I will stick with macos as I have spent more time booting into linux for the features of a tiling window manager etc.

I'm sure in time I will use macos a bit more again altho I really see it as a casual OS at the moment.

## dotfiles

So far I only have zsh related configs but will probably be adding more over the coming days/weeks.

* 31-01-2017 - added zshrc (based on zsh from linux)
